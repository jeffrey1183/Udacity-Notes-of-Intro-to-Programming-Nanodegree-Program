Programmers often describe computers as "stupid."

When they say this, they (usually) aren't insulting computers. 

In spoken languages, we can craft sentences with a great deal of ambiguity. 

Computer programming languages are designed to limit ambiguity, but sometimes this can result in issues between the programmer and the machine.
