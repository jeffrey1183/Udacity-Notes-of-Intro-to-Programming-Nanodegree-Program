#Getting Started with HTML
It's time to organize your notes in an HTML document and submit that document for review as your First Project.

Below, you'll see a screenshot of my notes from this section (displayed in Atom using HTML preview).

You can think of my notes as an example of what you'll want to build for your first project. However, what you share for this project should reflect the notes that you have taken from this section so that the feedback you receive is as helpful as possible. Head to the next section to see more specific instructions for submission.
