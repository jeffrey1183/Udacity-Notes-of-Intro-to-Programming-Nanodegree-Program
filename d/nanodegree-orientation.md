#How Does Project Submission Work?
You can submit each projects as many time as you need to. You will get the feedback and make changes. No one, even the most expert engineer write perfect code the first time around.

> 每次提交專案後會收到 feedback，這些 feedback 包含有沒有符合專案的規範(spec)，每個專案沒有提交次數上限，只要最後符合規範即可。這樣的過程跟現實生活中在公司工作一樣，沒人可以一開始就寫出完美的代碼。

# Project Deadlines
We've provided deadlines for you in order to help you graduate within our recommended time frame. But if you miss a deadline, don't worry! Just do your best to get back on schedule. There is no penalty for missing a deadline and you are more than welcome to go at your own pace!
>根據學生大約要花的時間，專案會出現截止日期，避免學生拖太久，但是如果你 delay 了，其實是不會影響你完成其他課程....

#Scheduling Time for Your Nanodegree
Think about when you'll be able to fit your Nanodegree program into your schedule. We recommend blocking off at least 3 or 4 separate learning sessions every week, with each one lasting 1 to 2 hours.


> 學習時間的安排上， Udacity 建議一周要花 10小時來上這門課，建議不要一次上 10 小時會暴斃，請分次來學習，每次1~2小時。學的安排自己固定學習的時間，讓習慣成自然。
