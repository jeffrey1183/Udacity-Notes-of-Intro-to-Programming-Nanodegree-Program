# Front End Programmer

要處理像：

* Fast Loading speed

* Responsive Design

* 拿Design mockups 套 Java. HTML



# [前端技術細項](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/03/web-dev-building-blocks-need-to-know-where-to-learn.html)

*  HTML5 & CSS
 * 無庸置疑前端需要先學這個




大致可以分成兩種類型的前端

* Design focused developers create sites that look and feel intuitive to the user. They spend most of their time writing HTML and CSS.

* Application focused developers use frameworks to create logic that powers interesting interactions user experience on websites. These developers most often use JavaScript.

還需要...
* 同理心 - 站在 user 的角度

* 拆解問題

* 與設計溝通

* Turn monolithic\(一大塊\) task into logical and reasonable chunks.

  


### What are important concepts Front-End programmers need to know:

* Focus on parts of the web that users see and interact with.

* Front-End developers access and present data from multiple sources on the internet through Application Program Interfaces \(APIs\).

* 多平台：A Front-End developer is someone who builds the interface on applications which run on a variety of devices. These interfaces should responsively transition from mobile to tablet to desktop.

* Every web page and web app is created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All of the images, buttons, transitions, animations, drop-down menus, contact forms, and styling elements are all controllable using these technologies.

  


### 要學的技術 \(What are some Front-End Frameworks Front-End developers use? \)

* Applications are built on top of frameworks like Angular.js, Ember.js, Backbone.js, Knockout.js, React.js and Polymer.js. There are similarities and differences, however if you can pick up one, you can pick up all of them.

* Front-End developers use frameworks like Angular.js and Ember.js to organize data using industry-standard design patterns which help synchronize user actions and data with a web server.

  


  


### Javascript libraries like JQuery and to use CSS framworks like Bootstrap.

  


Java 和 Python 的比較

While Javascript and Python are different, they share similarities as well: functions, variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements find their way in both languages.
