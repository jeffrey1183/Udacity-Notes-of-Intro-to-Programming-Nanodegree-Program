# ** **Getting Started with HTML

---

### **Atom **

* Atom as a text editor is that you can write your HTML code and also preview the web page right inside the editor as you make changes. You can split your window to see both views simultaneously, as shown below. 

>寫程式需要一個好用的編輯器，Atom 這個編輯器的好處是邊寫程式一邊還可以預覽網頁，馬上可以看到你的修改。 另外你還可以切畫面。

Note that, in general, you can split your screen into panes by going to the menu bar, selecting View→Panes, and choosing, for example, Split Right. Once you’ve split your screen, you can hover over the divider, click, and drag to adjust the pane width.

> 你可以從 View→Panes 去切畫面，例如下面的圖是 Split Right，開啟後你還可以調整視窗的寬度。
