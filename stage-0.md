First, you’ll need to install the package:

1. Open Atom. In the menu bar along the top of the window, select`Atom→Preferences`.

2. Select `Install`.

3. In the search field, type `atom-html-preview`, and hit the `RETURN` key on your keyboard. You should see the package appear with an option to Install it.

4. Click Install.

5. Once the package installation is complete, exit Preferences.

### **在 Atom 預覽 HTML, follow these steps:**

1. Open your HTML file.

2. Preview your HTML by typing on the keyboard: `control+shift+H`

Note that, in general, you can split your screen into panes by going to the menu bar, selecting View→Panes, and choosing, for example,Split Right. Once you’ve split your screen, you can hover over the divider, click, and drag to adjust the pane width.
