By the end of this program, you will have created dozens of impressive programs. For example, you'll have:

* Built a web page and put it online.

* Written computer code to automatically write emails.

* Assembled a large program by using existing code written by others as "pieces."


After doing these things, you'll be able to:

* Make an informed decision about what \(if any\) steps you want to take next.

* Converse deeply about computer science and programming without getting lost in computer speak.

* Explain big ideas in programming \(like how the internet works or how a program runs\) to a friend.

* Use programming to automate your own life.
